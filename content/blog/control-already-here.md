## Already here
I am most worried about political risk.  however if it is true as recently reported that the
the worlds richest 7 have doubled there wealth in the last year - this points to concnetrating
power in the hands of the few.  The risk I am worried about is the power being concentrated 
in the control of a super human artificial general intelligence (SHAGI).  This concentration
of power shows that it is real.

It is also not the worlds richest but the control from large tech companies which also provide control.
